Note that this project is an example, it shouldn't be used in production. 
Reasons:
 - Many errors aren't caught and are just shown to the user, without the rest of the page rendered. 
 - The code and layout is not inheritable, which makes this project hard to maintain. 
 - The database code is all over the place, making changes to the database will not be easy to reflect upon the code. 
 - The project has no localization support, all texts are hardcoded. 
Instead, create a project in a framework (like Symfony2 for example) and copy paste pieces from this project into that. 
This project uses no libraries which makes it easier to convert this project to a framework, or even to a different language.
This project has been developed using PHP 7.0.8 and tested using PHP 5.4.45. 


The /api/ folder contains the back-end, the /app/ folder contains the front-end. 


The database can be created by executing "_database_.sql". 
If you want to include the testing data, execute "_database_with_test_data_.sql" instead. 
The testing data, as well as the 'empty' data, both contain an admin account with the username "admin" and password "admin". 
The testing data also contains another admin account, as well as an advertiser and a developer account, for each the username is "test" and the password is " " (a single space). 


You will have to execute /api/admin/truncate_logged_ips.php once every day. 
You probably want to secure the /api/admin/ directory as well, by for example only allowing "localhost" / "127.0.0.1" / "::1".
